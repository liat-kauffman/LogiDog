Real-Time Data Updates

I chose to use SSE - Server-Sent Events.

The system requires fast updates about at-risk orders,
but there is no need for two-way continuous communication.

SSE provides a stable channel where the server pushes real-time updates to the dashboard with lower overhead compared to WebSockets.

Advantages (logistics-wise):

Immediate updates when a shipment status changes

Efficient for many clients and high scale

Simpler than WebSockets

Alternatives:

Polling - simple but inefficient and not real-time

WebSockets - good for two-way communication, but not needed here
