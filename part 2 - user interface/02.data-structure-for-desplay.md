Data Structure for Display

For the UI, I prefer a denormalized structure -
every shipment record contains all fields needed for display.
No joins needed.

Why denormalized is better here?

Read-only dashboard

Easy for the UI to filter and search without extra requests

Good performance - frontend gets a ready-to-display array

Simple updates through SSE as full objects

Normalized example (database level):

Shipments

ShipmentStatusHistory

Destinations

Categories

But for UI: denormalized is cleaner and faster.

At the database level we would use normalized structure,
but for this dashboard screen, denormalized is the right choice.
