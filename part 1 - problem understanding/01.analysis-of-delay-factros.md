Internal Delay Factors:

Delays that come from processes inside the company itself. For example, during busy periods like holidays, big sales or Black Friday, sorting centers and warehouses fill up quickly and this slows down the work pace.
Lack of manpower also has an impact - if there aren’t enough workers, stages like packing, sorting and loading take more time.
There are situations where inventory is not ready or documents are missing, and this delays the shipment from leaving. In addition, system failures like scanners that don’t work or a system outage cause statuses not to update correctly.
Sometimes packages even “disappear” in the system even though they actually progressed.
Another common situation is when the package didn’t make it onto the last truck of the day and is postponed to the next day - which creates an automatic delay.

External Delay Factors:

There are also delaying factors that are not related to the company but affect transit times.
For example, a truck that is supposed to pick up shipments is delayed, or an international flight is delayed or cancelled. Extreme weather such as storms, heavy snow, strong winds or flooding can stop truck movement or cause flight cancellations.
At ports there are sometimes heavy congestion situations, and containers can remain there for days before they are unloaded.
Customs can also cause delays - if documents are missing or there is a manual inspection, the shipment may get stuck on the same status for a long time.

Address and Delivery Issues:

If the address is inaccurate or new, or if the customer does not answer the phone, the courier cannot deliver the package and it is postponed to another day.
There are also remote areas where delivery happens only once or twice a week - which naturally causes delays.
