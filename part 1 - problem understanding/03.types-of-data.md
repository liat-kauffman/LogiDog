Data That Can Serve as Strong Indicators for Delay Prediction:
-Time Data-

Planned departure date

Timestamp of entering each stage

Actual time spent in each stage

End-of-day timing, daily load

Promised delivery date

Time remaining until delivery

These are important because delays are a time-based phenomenon.
Any deviation from expected timing is a strong indicator of delay.

-Progress-Stage Data-

Current shipment stage (SORTING, OUT_FOR_DELIVERY)

Actual stage transitions

“Stuck in stage” status (e.g., missing scans)

These matter because most logistics delays happen due to getting stuck in a stage.

-Exception Data-

Scan errors

Wrong address

Missing inventory / item not ready

Supplier pickup failure

Overweight / oversize issues

Driver route issue

These matter because exceptions are causal, not just symptoms.

-Operational Load Data-

Number of packages in the sorting center at the same time

Number of active shifts

Manpower

Driver load per region

Under heavy load, times increase across all shipments -> better delay prediction.

-External Data-

Weather

Traffic / roadblocks

Regional events

Seasonal peaks

Big sales

Delayed or cancelled flights

Congestion in ports or customs

These matter because they directly affect the odds of delay, even though they are outside the company.

-Supplier and Driver Data-

Average pickup times per supplier

Drivers with frequent exceptions

Sorting centers with high delay rates

These help identify weak points in the system.
