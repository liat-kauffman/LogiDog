Rule-Based Mechanism:

Advantages:

Simple to implement and maintain

Clear rules

Fast results

Easy to understand why an alert happened

Good for an initial system

No need for large historical data

Stable

Disadvantages:

Not flexible - may create many false alerts or miss delays

Doesn’t adapt to workload changes

Cannot detect complex patterns (e.g., “missing scan + heavy weight + specific supplier”)

ML-Based Mechanism:

Advantages:

More accurate - learns from history

Adapts to changing conditions

Detects missing scans / nonlinear patterns

Fewer false alerts

Disadvantages:

Requires lots of clean historical data

Less transparent (harder to explain decisions)

More complex to build and maintain

Requires ongoing monitoring and retraining

Recommended Choice

For the initial version of the system - Rule-Based.

Reasons:

At this early stage, there isn’t enough historical data for ML.

Managers need transparency to understand delay causes.

Easy to build, measure, and improve later.

Provides immediate value without heavy infrastructure.

Moving Later to Dynamic/ML

Once enough data is collected -
real scan times, many shipment movements, exceptions, workload patterns, weather, traffic -
then a model can be added to improve accuracy and reduce false alerts.

For the first version, a Rule-Based alert system is the best approach,
but if the company’s goal is a highly intelligent system,
then ML should absolutely be the next phase.
