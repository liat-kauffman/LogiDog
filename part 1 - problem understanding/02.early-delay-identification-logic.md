Early Detection of Shipments at Risk of Delay

To identify shipments that are at risk of delay, we can use logic based on a few basic data points:
the promised delivery date, how much time is left until that date, what stage the shipment is currently in, and how long it has been stuck in that stage.
The idea is to compare “what should be happening” with “what is actually happening.”

Time-Based Indicators

If the estimated arrival date is within the next 2–3 days
and the shipment hasn’t moved to the stage it should be in by now,
the system marks it as a shipment at risk of delay.

Progress-Stage Indicators

Each stage in the process has a maximum expected time.
If the shipment is stuck too long in the same stage,
the system marks it as a stage delay.
Example:
Staying more than 10 hours in Out for Delivery -> exceeds expected time -> alert.

Exception / Error-Based Indicators

If one of the following exceptions occurs -
failed scan
address issue
package not picked up by courier
severe weather / unusual traffic -
-> the system marks immediate delay risk.
