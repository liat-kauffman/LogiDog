Data Needed for ML Training

AI can use historical shipping data to learn accurate timing profiles for each shipment type.

Examples:

Shipment type (electronics, textile, furniture, food, medicine, etc.)

Weight and size

Delivery distance and route

Transportation type (ground, air, sea)

Supplier/driver historically assigned

This helps the model understand what to expect from each shipment type.
A large dataset improves average and statistical accuracy.

After many similar shipments, the system can learn things like:

Sorting center time: 18–35 minutes

Loading onto truck: 30–90 minutes

Distribution center unloading: 20–45 minutes

The model extracts this from averages and distributions.
Then it can recognize deviations and flag them.
